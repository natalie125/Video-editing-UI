## Project Overview
This project is a mobile application designed for video editing, tailored to users ranging from professional videographers to social media enthusiasts. The app offers a user-friendly interface with various features to help users edit their videos easily and efficiently.

**Key Features**:
- **Intuitive Editing Interface**: A simplified UI that allows users to edit videos with minimal complexity.
- **Accessibility**: Features like clear font sizes and large buttons make it accessible for users with visual or auditory impairments.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: The app runs on smartphones with any operating system.
- **Video Storage & Re-editing**: Users can save and re-edit their videos at any time.
- **No User Data Collection**: The app guarantees user privacy by not storing or selling edited videos or personal data.

## Use Cases
1. **Influencers** (e.g., YouTubers) can create polished, professional videos with effects and share them with their audience.
2. **Outdoor Enthusiasts** (e.g., skiers) can record, edit, and share action footage with custom effects.
3. **Students** can create video projects with ease, combining clips, adding transitions, and submitting for academic assignments.

## Iterative Development
The development of the app followed an iterative process, starting from basic wireframes and evolving with feedback from users to include more features and refinements.

### Iteration 1:
- **Goal**: Establish a basic layout and UI inspired by popular apps like Capcut and VLC.
- **Outcome**: Created a questionnaire to gather feedback on the initial design, which was used to select the final layout.

### Iteration 2:
- **Goal**: Add key features like text editing, filters, and stickers based on feedback.
- **Outcome**: Updated the wireframe to incorporate these features, making the app more intuitive and functional.

### Iteration 3:
- **Goal**: Finalize the app's design, including color schemes and removing unnecessary elements.
- **Outcome**: Created a sleek black-and-white UI with green accents for selected features.

## Challenges & Limitations
- **No Internet Connectivity**: The app currently lacks embedded internet connectivity for file sharing. Users can only share files through Bluetooth or external apps.
- **Limited Audio Controls**: The app does not yet support features like subtitles or voice recognition, which are planned for future releases.
